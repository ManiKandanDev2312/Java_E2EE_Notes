Java Concepts:


New Concepts I learnt until now:

1.jshell which is used to write and execute the java programme in command prompt itself.

2.some sample commands of jshell like:

-- /help intro - which is used to listout commands which we need to use in jshell.
-- /list -all - this command is used to listout the statement which we perform perviously in jshell.
-- /var - this command is used to listout the variables only.
-- /exit - this command is used to exit from jshell.
-- /reset - this command is used to reset the jshell.

3.overflow and underflow concept in primitive data types is also called as Wraparounds.

-- overlow condition - which means we try to store the value which is more than limit for the datatype. 
-- underflow condition - which means we try to store the value which is lesser than limit for the datatype.

Note : in this situation compiler does not throw any error (whenever we use expression apart from the literal values).

For Example:
int intMaxvalue = Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1: // overflow condition
int intMinvalue = Integer.MIN_VALUE - 1: // underflow condition

4.whenever we need to put a comma in integer value to easily identify like 1,000 instead of this we can use 1_000 is acceptable in Java.

5.using the Expression while storing the value in variable like whole number is default consider a int so we try to store the value to 
Byte and short datatype is throw an error.

For Example:
byte minByteValue = Byte.MIN_VALUE;
bye myNewByteValue = (minByteValue/2);// its throw an error because without casting we can't store int to byte variable.

6.usage of unicode in char datatype For Example: char uniCode = '\u0044'; output : 'D'.

7.Create a boolean variable by using this prefix like is or has both have different meaning for the variable.
For Example:
is : 
isValid
isEmployeeID
isSubcriptionType

has:
hasChild
hasSubcription

8.String are mutable that means it creates a new string while try to concatenate instead of string for this process we are having String Builder for that
Because that is immutable.

9.character can't perform concatenate the character which we are provided instead character changes their given character to ASCII value of character in 
numbers after that they perform concatenate process it returns single integer Value.

For Example:

char firstChar = 'A'; char secondChar = 'B' ; System.out.print(firstChar + secondChar); // 131

10. character can be contatenate by using like this:

For Example:

char firstChar = 'A'; char secondChar = 'B' ; System.out.print( "" + firstChar + secondChar); // AB

11. compound operator is can't throw the datatype error.

For Example:
int a = 1;

a += 2.5;//3 because its defines a = (datatype) (a + 2.5); actually here pereform internal cast.
